# LDMLCS-algorithm
LDMLCS can generate numerous decomposable models, including simple models such as TAN and complex models with large joint marginal distribution, and some models that could be used for classification on a given dataset.

Here is the implementation of the the algorithm proposed in the paper entitled "A new probabilistic classifier based on decomposable models with application to internet traffic" using Matlab code:  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320317304958
